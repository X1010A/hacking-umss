# Features
Here's a list of the features included:

## TypeScript 
Already applied to the entire project and ready to be used in your custom components.

## TailwindCSS 2.0.2
The entire blog was built using tailwindcss. The [typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) was also used to generate beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML on your posts.

## Markdown support 
To start adding your posts using markdown, just add new .md files within the posts folder located in the root of the project.

### Syntax highlight
All your posts will include syntax highlight thanks to [unified.js](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) and [remark-highlight](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-highlight.js?files=1)

### Metadata
You can easily add meta-data to your blog posts by including the following heading at the top:
```md
---
title: 'Title for your blog post'
date: '2021-01-07'
description: 'Description of your blog posts'
coverUrl: 'https://path/to/your/post/cover/image.png'
tags: 'nextjs,tailwindcss,markdown'
theme: 'indigo'
---
```
### Themes
By adding the "theme" metadata at the top of your posts, you can change the accent color for each post. This feature use the tailwindcss colors behind the scene so you can choose between red, green, blue, indigo, yellow, etc.

### Series
You can optionally add the "series" metadata at the top of your posts to create series. Series will allow you to easily group two or more posts

# Customization

## Updating social links and home description
You'll find a `config.ts` in the root of the project. There you can easily change or delete your social links or even add new ones. You'll also we able to update your blog description using the same file like this:
```ts
// config.ts
const Config: ConfigProps = {
    socialLinks: [
        {
            icon: faTwitter,
            url: "https://twitter.com/your-twitter-handle"
        },
        {
            icon: faInstagram,
            url: "https://www.instagram.com/your-instagram-handle/"
        },
        // Add as many social links as you want
    ],
    // Here you can change your blog description
    blogDescription: "Description for your blog"
}
```

## Update blog's title
To update your blog's title, just go to `./components/hero.tsx` and change the following section:
```ts
<h1 className="text-4xl tracking-tight font-extrabold text-cool-gray-900 sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl">
    // Change this section
    <span>techblog</span>
    <span className="text-indigo-600 xl:inline">.dev</span>
</h1>
```

## Navbar customization
### Hiding links
The navbar already comes with a set of links that are displayed by default:

If you want to get rid of them, go to `./components/layout.tsx` and add `showLinks={false}` in the navbar component likes this:
```ts
const Layout = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-200 min-h-screen">
      <Navbar showLinks={false}></Navbar>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Add/Change the existing links
If you want to update the existing links, go to `./config.ts` and update the following section:
```ts
const Config: ConfigProps = {
    ...
    navbarLinks: [
        {
            text: "Link 1",
            href: "#"
        },
        // Add your custom links here
    ]
}
```
